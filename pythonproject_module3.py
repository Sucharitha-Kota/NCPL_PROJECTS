A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope.

Local Scope: A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.

Global Scope: A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope. Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.

Global Keyword: If you need to create a global variable, but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the global keyword. The global keyword makes the variable global.

Nonlocal Keyword: The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variables inside nested functions. The nonlocal keyword makes the variable belong to the outer function.

"""#7)Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries


1. Lists in Python:

A list is an ordered collection of items which can be of any type. Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified after creation (i.e., elements can be added, removed, or modified).

2. Tuples in Python:

A tuple is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list, but it is immutable. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.


3. Sets in Python:

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are mutable, but they do not allow duplicate elements, and their order is not guaranteed.

4. Dictionaries in Python:

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. The keys in a dictionary must be unique, while the values can be of any data type. Dictionaries are mutable.

"""b)Understand the differences between these data structures.

Each of the four data structures in Pythonâ€”lists, tuples, sets, and dictionariesâ€”has distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different use cases.

Differences

Lists:

Ordered collection.
Items are stored in a specific order, and that order is maintained.
Elements can be accessed using their index (e.g., list[0]).
The order of elements in a list is guaranteed (starting from Python 3.7+).


Tuples:

Ordered collection.
Like lists, tuples maintain the order of elements.
Can be accessed via indexing (e.g., tuple[0]).


Sets:

Unordered collection.
The elements do not have a fixed position, so the order of elements is not preserved.
Cannot access elements by index. Elements can only be accessed through iteration.


Dictionaries:

Unordered (until Python 3.7+ where insertion order is preserved).
Data is stored as key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and values are accessed using the key (e.g., dict["key"]).
Insertion order is maintained in Python 3.7+, meaning the items will be returned in the same order they were added.


Use Cases

Lists:

Best used when you need an ordered collection of items that might change.
Ideal for use cases where the order of elements is important, and modifications like adding/removing elements are needed.

Example: Storing a sequence of tasks in a to-do list or a series of steps in a process.

Tuples:

Best used when you need an ordered collection of items that should not be modified.
Ideal for use cases where the integrity of the data should be maintained, and immutability is required (e.g., coordinates, function return values).

Example: Representing fixed data like geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) or RGB values.

Sets:

Best used when you need a collection of unique items and order doesn't matter.
Ideal for removing duplicates, checking membership, or performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

Example: Storing unique items, such as a list of distinct tags or items in a collection.

Dictionaries:

Best used when you need a key-value mapping, with fast lookups by key.
Ideal for associating data that can be accessed quickly via a unique identifier (key).

Example: Storing user information by user ID, or mapping product IDs to product details.
